# How to get Plangrid
As per usual for all my Siege projects, this is the way I recommend but there are other ways to sideload apps onto iOS/iPadOS devices such as AltStore or SideStore which *should* work, there's no reason for them not to!
1. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) and its dependencies; iirc there are none on macOS but on Windows you need iTunes and iCloud **not from the Microsoft Store!** The Sideloadly website will link you to everything you need for your OS.
2. From the [Releases](https://github.com/ConsciousBone/Plangrid/releases/tag/stable) tab, find the latest release - it should be at the top - and download the attached `Plangrid.ipa` file.
3. Using a cable that supports both charge *and* data transfer, connect your device (iPhone or iPad, the sideloading process for Macs and AVPs is weird and I don't feel like figuring it out, you're on your own) to your computer, and if prompted, select `Trust` and enter your password, then open Sideloadly.
4. In Sideloadly, click the file icon with the `IPA` text and select the previously downloaded `Plangrid.ipa` file.
5. Select your device in the `iDevice` dropdown, and make sure the name matches with the device you wish to sideload Plangrid to.
6. In the `Apple ID` text field, enter your Apple Account/ID's email. If your account does not have a paid and active Apple Developer subscription, you will have to reinstall/resign the app every 7 days, but if you have a Developer subscription this goes to a pretty decent 365 days!
7. Click the `Start` button, and enter your Apple Account/ID's password when prompted to. **This password goes straight to Apple; no one apart from you and Apple will ever see this password. Not the developers of Sideloadly, and not me.**
8. Wait for the app to install, and then launch it! *If you are prompted to enable Developer Mode or trust the app/developer, then do so.*
